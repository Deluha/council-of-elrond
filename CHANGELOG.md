# Changelog

All notable changes to the mod are listed here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); versions follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) and are the `version` field of
`mods/council-of-elrond/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`. Before 1.0.0, a minor bump may change
behaviour.

Each stage of the original build order (SPEC §20) landed as one pull request.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Stage 5 ([Deluha/council-of-elrond#5](https://github.com/Deluha/council-of-elrond/pull/5)):
  an allow rule offered after "allow once", once the call has run, written to `rules.json` only
  on "Add the rule"; `/council report` over the audit log and its rotated files (most refused,
  stopped then allowed, shadow verdicts, cost and median review time per reviewer); the
  `reviewMs` audit field; one shared, validating writer for `rules.json`.
- Project documentation for contributors and maintainers: `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`,
  `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `SUPPORT.md`, this changelog, issue and pull request templates, CI and a
  release workflow, git hooks, CODEOWNERS, a marketplace manifest, `docs/`.

### Changed
- The review's rules-tier section is published as categories only until the hardening release;
  the triggering inputs are held in a private security advisory.
- `mods/types/NOTICE.md` states what the vendored API declarations are and that the MIT licence
  makes no claim over them.

### Notes
- The manifest still says 0.4.0; Stage 5 did not bump it. The next release should be 0.5.0.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-10-05

Stage 4 ([Deluha/council-of-elrond#4](https://github.com/Deluha/council-of-elrond/pull/4)).

### Added
- The full council for big operations (`git push`, a merge into a protected branch, a database
  migration; `bigOperations` in `rules.json`): every enabled reviewer sits at once on one model
  under one deadline, strictest verdict wins, each objection labelled.
- Project checks (Gimli): `gimli.commands` from `rules.json` run alongside the council by argv
  with no shell, each with its own timeout; a failure blocks and Claude gets the last 20 lines.
- The diff reviewer reviews the range a push would send or a merge would bring in.
- `/config` rows: full council on/off, its model, one at a time, project checks on/off.
- The audit line's `council` field (what made it big, each voice, each check).

### Changed
- A mixed compound command that contains a big operation goes to the full council; other mixed
  commands stay with Gandalf.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-10-05

Stage 3 ([Deluha/council-of-elrond#3](https://github.com/Deluha/council-of-elrond/pull/3)).

### Added
- Legolas, the diff reviewer: a diff built from the call against the file as it stands (Edit,
  Write, NotebookEdit), cut to the diff line limit.
- Aragorn with two profiles: git (push, merge, rebase, reset, tag, amend) and database (SQL
  clients, migrations, `.sql` files inside the project, production patterns).
- Routing: the rule's member and profile decide, Gandalf is the fallback; `/council test` prints
  the fallback and why.
- `/config` rows for Legolas and Aragorn (enabled, model) and the diff line limit.
- Previews for `git merge` and `git commit --amend`.

### Fixed
- A reviewer's reason containing a file name was cut at the dot.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-10-05

Stage 2 ([Deluha/council-of-elrond#2](https://github.com/Deluha/council-of-elrond/pull/2)).

### Added
- Gollum, the secrets scan: high-confidence findings refused, low-confidence ones asked, an
  allowlist of fingerprints written only after a second confirmation.
- Galadriel, the read-only preview from a fixed command table.
- Operation keys, review rounds, failed attempts and lockout; the approve cache until the next
  prompt.
- The `/council` command: status, `off`/`on`, `shadow`, `log`, `rules`, `test`, `model`, `reload`.
- Shadow mode (session switch and `/config`), the mode label by the prompt.
- The user's own refusal at Claude Code's permission prompt counts as a failed attempt; an
  automatic denial does not.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-05

Stage 1 ([Deluha/council-of-elrond#1](https://github.com/Deluha/council-of-elrond/pull/1)).

### Added
- Elrond's pipeline on `tool.call`: the rules tier (allow, review, ask, block; compound commands
  split; protected paths), Gandalf as the single reviewer, escalation to the user with allow once,
  keep blocked and a typed instruction, fail-closed handling, and the JSONL audit log with
  rotation. Plain mode only.
